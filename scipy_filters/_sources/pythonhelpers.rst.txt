Helpers for the Python console
==============================

:py:class:`helpers.RasterWizard` helps to get the data of a QGIS raster layer as a numpy array, and the processing result back into QGIS as a new raster layer.

:py:class:`helpers.RasterWindow` can be used to process large rasters in a moving window.
